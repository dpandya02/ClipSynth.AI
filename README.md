# ClipSynth.AI

A web application for video synthesis and animation.

## Overview

ClipSynth.AI is a web-based platform for creating engaging content with AI-powered video synthesis. It allows users to transform their content into attention-grabbing videos by overlaying text on gameplay footage, generating AI content, and exporting professional-quality videos in minutes.

## Features

- **UI Editor**: A graphical user interface for designing and editing video compositions, including the ability to select and customize elements, adjust timing and alignment, and apply effects.
- **AI Video Synthesis**: The platform utilizes AI-powered algorithms to generate high-quality video content, including the ability to create animation and visual effects.
- **Video Preview**: A preview component allows users to see their video content in real-time, with the ability to make adjustments before final export.
- **Timeline**: A visual timeline component for editing video clips and compositions, allowing users to adjust timing, alignment, and other properties.
- **Video Upload**: The ability to upload video files for synthesis and composition.

## Core Functionality

- **Video Composition**: Users can select and combine multiple video elements to create a single, cohesive composition.
- **Element Animation**: The ability to animate individual elements, including text, images, and other visual components.
- **Timing and Alignment**: Precise control over the timing and alignment of video elements.
- **Visual Effects**: A variety of visual effects can be applied to enhance the engagement and aesthetic of videos.

## Development Overview

This project is built using React, with a focus on web-based development and deployment. Key dependencies include React Router for client-side routing, and React-DOM for rendering the application to the DOM.

## Setup and Installation

**1. Activate Virtual Environment:**

   Before starting, ensure you've activated your virtual environment.

   ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

**2. Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required packages using pip.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**3. Start the Servers:**
   - **Backend:** 
     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload
     ```
   - **Frontend:** Navigate to your project's front-end directory (e.g., `client`) and start the development server for React:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

**4. Access the Application:**  
   Once both servers are running, access the application in your browser at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (or the address specified in your `main.py`).

## Roadmap

Future development plans for ClipSynth.AI include:

* **Advanced AI Features**: Integration of more advanced AI algorithms and capabilities, including machine learning and deep learning models.
* **Multi-Language Support**: Support for multiple languages, including text-to-speech and translation capabilities.
